# KUBERNETES: WRITE YOUR FIRST CUSTOM HELM CHART FROM SCRATCH
---
>Goal: 
- This document was created to showcase how we can develop a custom HELM chart to build an application.
- I will keep updating this document until we're done with the video series

## Pre-requisites:
- An OS of your choice (I am using `Rocky Linux 10`)
- A `Kubernetes cluster` up and running (Minikube, kind, k3s or any)
- `Kubectl` to interact with the cluster api server
- `Helm` command line tool
- Good knowledge of `Kubernetes`

## Folder structure
```sh
monlabolinux/ --> Root folder of the helm chart
â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml --> Chart information
â”œâ”€â”€ files --> Will be useful for video 06 of the video series
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md --> "What you're actually learning"
â”œâ”€â”€ templates --> Kubernetes templatized files and NOTES.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configmaps.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NOTES.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.yaml
â””â”€â”€ values.yaml --> Values to your templatized files

3 directories, 8 files
```
